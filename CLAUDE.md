### External LLMs

To use external models (kimi, grok, grok-fast, glm, gemini, gpt-5), just mention them in your response:

- "I'll use kimi to write this"
- "Let me ask grok about that"
- "Using gemini to analyze this"

Add "external-llm" if not triggering automatically.

Never run openrouter.sh or install.sh directly - the agent handles everything.
